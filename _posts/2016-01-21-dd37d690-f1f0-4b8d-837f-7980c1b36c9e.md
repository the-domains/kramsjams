Once upon a time there were a lot of lawns cut and a Tascam 4-track was purchased with the profits. Now, 15 or so years later, much more musical equipment has been amassed, lots of shows have been played, many songs have been recorded and Kram's Jams is ready to move into a professional studio setup in Northeast Minneapolis. The goal is to create a creative and comfortable space where musicians can do excellent work. Here is to new adventures!
